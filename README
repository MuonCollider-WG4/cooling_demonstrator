Cooling demonstrator lattice
----------------------------

This repo contains the lattice files for the cooling demonstrator. Contents:
* chicane: contains the transport line from the target through to the cooling
           channel start
* cooling: cooling lattice

Release notes
-------------

2024-05-23-prerelease:
optimised the cooling cell lattice, including absorber thickness, window thickness, RF iris radius, RF parameters
added documentation
note that bdsim lattice is at an early stage and not consistent with the g4bl lattice - please use g4bl for now
this should be considered the baseline to take forwards for hardware design

2024-04-16-prerelease: just looking at solenoids; scaling the lattice to 0.8 m
cell length to better fit the RF cavities. See discussion here:

2024-03-01-prerelease: just looking at solenoids; adapting the NuFact lattice to
use a slightly more realistic solenoid geometry. See discussion here:

2022-11-01-release: this is the lattice presented at NuFact. It is published at

Release procedure
-----------------
To make a release:
* Go to github.com
* Click on the branch (typically drop down menu called <master>)
* Type in the name of the release "YYYY-MM-DD-prerelease" and click "Create branch YYYY-MM-DD-prerelease from master"
* At CLI do 'git checkout YYYY-MM-DD-prerelease'
** You should now be in branch YYYY-MM-DD-prerelease
** Update the README file and make any changes
** Commit and push
* do 'git checkout master'
* Bring the changes back into the master with 'git merge YYYY-MM-DD-prerelease'
* Commit and push
