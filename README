Cooling demonstrator lattice
----------------------------

This repo contains the lattice files for the cooling demonstrator. Contents:
* chicane: contains the transport line from the target through to the cooling
           channel start
* cooling: cooling lattice

Release notes
-------------

2022-11-01-release: this is the lattice presented at NuFact. It is published at
http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/psf2023008037

2024-03-01-prerelease: just looking at solenoids; adapting the NuFact lattice to
use a slightly more realistic solenoid geometry. See discussion here:
